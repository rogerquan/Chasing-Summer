Student project for SJSU's Web Based Computing class

At the end of the Fall 2021 semester our project group, XFestival, will create a website to highlight the coding skills each team member has gained this semester. The website we plan to create in this project is a promotional site for the fictional music festival, Chasing Summer. The website will be similar in functionality to popular music festivals such as Coachella, Rolling Loud, and Lollapalooza, and our site will include pages that allow a user to purchase tickets, book hotel rooms and buy merchandise from performing artists. There will be four major pages, these include Home, Booking, Tickets, and Shops. The Home page will have pictures of the event and a lineup poster. In the Booking page there will be pictures and links to various hotels that guests of the festival can stay. The Shops page will have pictures of the headlining artists each day and will also link to each artist's existing merchandise page. The Ticket page will show users two ticket options, a general admission ticket and a VIP ticket. The page will also include differences between the two ticket options and will tell users that tickets are not available yet but will go on sale soon. This project will not cost anything to make and any purchasing features will be done on third party pages. At the end of this project, our site will be delivered to Professor Dhar for review.
